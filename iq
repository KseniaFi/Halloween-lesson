        <p>The village of Maplewood is a charming little community known for its friendly people and beautiful natural surroundings. Every autumn, Maplewood transforms into a magical world, bursting with colours and joyful sounds. This special season brings everyone together to celebrate Halloween with fun and festive traditions.</p>
        
        <p>The festival's decorations light up the streets, and children's excitement grows as they prepare their costumes. Bright orange pumpkins are placed on every doorstep, and flickering lanterns light up the village hall.</p>
        
        <p>Mia and her brother Tom spend the afternoon carefully arranging their granny's large, bright pumpkins to prepare them for carving. Granny's pumpkins are big and bright, perfect for carving scary faces.</p>
        
        <p>The village's pumpkin competition is the most popular event, and everyone hopes to win Granny's special prize. At the festival, there are many fun activities. Children can carve pumpkins, paint their faces, or make sparkling cobweb decorations.</p>
        
        <p>The storyteller shares tales of friendly witches and magical pumpkins. The wizard's staff glows softly as the children listen carefully.</p>
        
        <p>Lantern bearers walk through the village carrying glowing lanterns shaped like bats, ghosts, and witches' hats. Music plays as the parade moves past the school and the old library.</p>
        
        <p>The festival's magic fills the air, making everyone feel happy and brave. At the end of the night, fireworks light up the sky with orange, purple, and green colours. The village's Halloween festival is a night full of joy, magic, and friendship.</p>
